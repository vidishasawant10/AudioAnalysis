i'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. truth be told i never graduated from college and this is the closest i've ever gotten to a college graduation. today i want to tell you three stories from my life. that's it. no big deal just three stories. the first story is about connecting the dots. i dropped out of college after the first 6 months but then stayed around as a drop-in for another eighteen months or so before. i really quit so wide i dropout. it started before i was born my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and he decided to put me up for adoption. she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set set for me to be adopted. at birth by a lawyer and his wife accept it. when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really want a girl. so my parents who are on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we got an unexpected baby boy do you want him they said of course. my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college. and if my father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final adoption papers. she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college. this was the start in my life. and 17 years later i did go to college but i not eat.
